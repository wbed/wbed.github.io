## Nutella Pancakes

### Ingredients
- 160g all purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 200g milk (+ 1 tbsp vinegar to soften)
- 1 egg
- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 75g Nutella

### Instructions
1. Heat the Nutella jar for few seconds in a microwave until it becomes less thick, and spread 3 nutella disks (with a diameter of 7cm) onto parchment paper.
2. Place the Nutella disks in the freezer for 30 minutes.
3. In a large bowl, sift and mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and sugar.
4. In a medium sized bowl, mix together the milk, eggs, vegetable oil and vanilla.
5. Pour the milk mix gradually into the flour mix and mix until you get a batter: do not overbeat the batter! It doesn't matter if there are some small flour lumps, but don't mix it too much.
6. Preheat a small non-stick pan over low heat.
7. Slightly grease the pan with butter, and absorb the excess with kitchen roll.
8. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan, then immediately place one frozen nutella disk in the middle, then pour 1/4 cup of batter on top of Nutella.
9. Lower the heat to the minimum, cover the pan with a small lid and cook for about 5 minutes (or until the top sides are firm but the middle batter on top is stil runny, and the bottom is golden brown.)
10. Flip pancake and cook for a few more minutes until the bottom is golden brown.
11. Serve
