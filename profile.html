    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <h3>Technical Clerk â€“ Azedinha Ltd. (25 August â€“ 18 September 2025)</h3>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Engineering<br><strong>Type:</strong> Temporary</p>
    <p>I worked for a month preparing engineering specifications, datasheets and schedules for mechanical equipment, during the front-end design phase of a sustainable aviation fuel project, where the primary aim was producing a Â±30% cost estimate.</p>
    <p>This involved adapting existing go-by specifications sourced from prior projects, and altering the body to make it specific for the current project, ensuring that all the relevant UK regulations, and codes and standards were present in the specification, as well as cross-referencing information from other project documents.</p>
    <p>I produced datasheet templates (using go-bys) for mechanical equipment and packages, including pumps, compressors, pressure vessels, and air compressor packages, as well as emergency diesel generators, firewater pumps and others.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, I made schedule templates from scratch, extracting important information from the datasheets about the conditions and inputs/outputs required for the equipment, so that these schedules could be sent to vendors in order to provide a preliminary cost estimate.</p>
    <p>Overall, I gained a familiarity with the stages of project design, as well as the importance of keeping costs low by reducing the amount of equipment required â€” which was emphasised due to the tight budgetary constraints, as the project was dependent on government grants. I also gained a familiarity in preparing documents for interdepartmental checks, and producing deliverables.</p>

    <h3>Work Experience Student â€“ Technip Energies (11 â€“ 22 August 2025)</h3>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Engineering</p>
    <p>I spent two weeks in Technip gaining experience in their materials division, examining corrosion mechanisms in sustainable aviation fuel plants.</p>
    <p>Using ASM (American Society for Metals) handbooks, and referencing Chemical Flow Diagrams and fluid composition/property tables, I produced a technical report detailing the materials selection required in mitigating organic (formic/acetic) acid corrosion in steels, drawing conclusions on the types required, compromising between the most economical and the most corrosion-resistant options.</p>
    <p>While examining flue gas corrosion mechanisms involving acid dew points and chloride contaminants, I compiled a technical report on steel alloy use in flue gas desulphurisation systems, specifically in mitigating sulphuric acid corrosion.</p>
    <p>I developed an understanding of insulation usage in pipework, including potential failure mechanisms such as corrosion under insulation, and also painting standards and requirements, which depend on environmental conditions and other corrosion mechanisms.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I received an overview in various other disciplines, including piping, chemical/process and mechanical engineering.</p>

    <h3>Work Experience Student â€“ Elliott Wood (29 July â€“ 2 August 2024)</h3>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Engineering design and construction</p>
    <p>I worked with structural and environmental engineers for a week, completing an independent project focussing on planning for a structural engineering project.</p>
    <p>During the project, I wrote a desk study examining the geological character of the site, unexploded ordinance and the expected environmental impact of the project, and determined the suggested structural components for use in a construction, and completed calculations using simulation software to determine the support size and strength.</p>
    <p>Finally, I used the carbon dioxide emissions of production of all the materials, as well as typical carbon dioxide emissions in construction, to determine the overall environmental impact of the project in equivalent kilograms of carbon dioxide.</p>

    <h3>Work Experience Student â€“ Technip Energies (10 â€“ 14 July 2023)</h3>
    <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Engineering</p>
    <p>Gained an awareness of the basics of corrosion mechanisms and the importance of materials selection in preventing corrosion and contamination in a system.</p>
    <p>Completed an independent exercise selecting the correct materials for use in high temperature hydrogen conditions, using heat/material tables and documentation from the American Petroleum Institute.</p>
    <p>During this exercise, I developed an understanding of the failure mechanisms resulting from high temperature hydrogen conditions (high temperature hydrogen attack) where atomic hydrogen penetrates steel structures, leading to decarburisation and failure.</p>
    <p>I also attended presentations by international companies producing high speed pumps and compressors for use in petrochemical plants.</p>
